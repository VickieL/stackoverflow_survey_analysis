## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. Does developer's interest/preference impact their job satisfaction or career satisfaction?
2. What are developer's preferred, what are not?
3. What does developer care about when accessing a potential job?
4. What is important in Globex's hiring process?
5. When most developers prefer to start work?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 jupyter notebook available here to explore above questions. Each question has a title (Markdown cells) in the notebook, so it can be easily read from part to part.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
